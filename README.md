# Tokfetch Manager
___________


Tokfetch Manager provides technical operations for balance monitoring:

-   Fetching balances of tokens
-   Printing out richlist table

The command line tool is locally installed via Docker and available for
Windows, OSX and Linux. The API is written in Python programming
language.

## Installation
### Requirements
Skills needed

- Command line usage experience
- Ethereum and smart contract experience 

Software or services needed:
- Ethereum node, for example a local Parity installation or Infura-node-as-a-service
- Docker

### Advanced users

The `tokfetch` command line application is provided as a Docker image to minimize the issues with painful native dependency set up for your operating system. To use `tokfetch` we will set up a command line alias, as Docker command itself is quite long.

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (Linux, OSX).

### OSX and Linux
Set up a shell alias for sto command that executes Dockerised binary:

```shell
alias tokfetch='docker run -p 2222:2222 -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` ilyaliko/tokfetch:latest'
```

Then you can do:

```shell 
tokfetch --help
```

Docker will automatically pull an image from Docker registry for your local computer on the first run. We map port 2222 to the localhost.

After installing see how to set up the software.

###Developers
Python 3.6+ required.

Create Python virtual environment.

Then within the activated venv do:

```shell
git clone "git+https://github.com/TokenMarketNet/sto.git"
python -m venv venv  # Python 3 needed
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip  # Make sure you are at least pip 18.1 - older versions will fail
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
```
